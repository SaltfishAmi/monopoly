# Features

You have:
* Roll a dice for steps and advance
* Buy estate from the system ~~or other players~~
* Click on any cell and read its information
* Pay tolls or get awards passing specific cells
* Save to and load from the browser cookies
* Save to a text string and paste it after for loading
* Two maps that we made based on real world streets
* Simple and easy-to-understand interface

You **don't** have:
* Multi-player, either local or online, 'cause it's not implemented. Play with your self.
* Generally applicable maps, 'cause the maps are just restaurants around our school.
* Up-to-date maps, 'cause the maps are drawn approximately 2 years ago, and many restaurants may have bankrupted in this period.
* Frameworks or other fancy thingy, 'cause the whole thing is smaller than a jquery.js and there is no reason to make it huge.
